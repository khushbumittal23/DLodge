      <div class="row">
        <p class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1 ">Drumnahay Lodge is situated in one of
									Northern Ireland’s designated areas of Outstanding Natural
									Beauty. The panoramic views from every window take in the
									majestic Benevenagh Mountain to the front which dominates the
									skyline, whilst to either side there is the vast stretch of
									Magilligan’s plains. To the rear are the blue-misted rolling
									hills of Donegal, clearly visible across the shores of Lough
									Foyle. The Lodge is a spacious country cottage, formerly a
									family residence. It is a NITB (Northern Ireland Tourist Board)
									Approved self-catering accommodation. It is untypical in the
									self catering market as it retains that quality and character
									of a genuine home. The lodge is spacious, secluded and private
									— the perfect retreat for those who wish to get away from the
									hustle and bustle of urban living and is particularly well
									suited for family groups. It is accessed by a private lane
									which is about half a mile long from the main road. It enjoys
									the privacy of having no close neighbours, yet it remains
									accessible to all local amenities. </p>
		<p class="col-md-5">The local Spar is about 2
									miles away. This family run store offers everything you will
									need for your holidays. The nearest pub/restaurant is also
									about 2 miles away, situated at Magilligan Point.You can stop
									for a bite to eat at Magilligan Point Bar before catching the
									ferry which will take you across to Greencastle, Donegal. Two
									miles in the other direction from Drumnahay towards Limavady,
									you can eat at Coast which is also a traditional pub/restaurant
									situated in the village of Myroe. Bellarena station, a small
									station on the main Belfast to Derry route is situated at the
									lane’s end where it meets the main A2 road. Bellarena level
									crossing is the most reliable signpost to give guests, as the
									turn off for the lane leading to the property is exactly
									here.The nearest main town is Limavady which is about 8 miles
									away, the road passing through pleasant villages and farmland
									of Myroe and Anaghloo and over the impressive River Roe at
									Swann’s Bridge, one of the best angling rivers in the area.</p>
